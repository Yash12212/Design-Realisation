            <summary>Use Strong, Unique Passwords</summary>
            <p>Strong, unique passwords are your first line of defense against unauthorized access to your accounts.</p>
            <h4>Tips for creating and managing strong passwords:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Use at least 16 characters, including a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols</li>
                <li>Avoid using personal information or common words</li>
                <li>Use a different password for each account</li>
                <li>Consider using passphrases - long sequences of random words</li>
                <li>Use a reputable password manager to generate and store complex passwords securely</li>
                <li>Regularly update your passwords, especially after a known data breach</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Remember, never share your passwords with anyone, and avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</summary>
            <p>Multi-Factor Authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring additional verification beyond just a password.</p>
            <h4>Best practices for MFA:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable MFA on all accounts that offer it, especially email, financial, and social media accounts</li>
                <li>Use app-based authenticators (like Google Authenticator or Authy) instead of SMS-based authentication when possible</li>
                <li>Consider using hardware security keys for the highest level of protection</li>
                <li>Be cautious of phishing attempts that try to steal your MFA codes</li>
                <li>Set up backup methods for account recovery in case you lose access to your primary MFA device</li>
            </ul>
            <p>While any form of MFA is better than none, app-based or hardware token methods are generally more secure than SMS-based MFA.</p>
        </details>
        <details>
            <summary>Keep Software Updated</summary>
            <p>Regular software updates are crucial for patching security vulnerabilities and protecting against the latest threats.</p>
            <h4>Best practices for software updates:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Enable automatic updates for your operating system and all applications</li>
                <li>Regularly check for updates manually if automatic updates are not available</li>
                <li>Update all devices, including smartphones, tablets, and IoT devices</li>
                <li>Be cautious of fake update notifications - always download updates from official sources</li>
                <li>Consider using a patch management solution for multiple devices</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Keeping your software updated is one of the most effective ways to protect against known vulnerabilities and exploits.</p>
