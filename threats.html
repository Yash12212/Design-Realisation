                    <p>Imagine getting a letter that looks like it's from your bank, but it's actually from a scammer. That's what phishing is - but online!</p>
                    <h4>How to Spot Fake Messages:</h4>

                        <li><strong>Urgent Messages:</strong> "Your account will be closed if you don't act now!" - Real companies don't pressure you like this.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strange Email Addresses:</strong> amazonsupport@gmail.com instead of @amazon.com</li>
                        <li><strong>Spelling Mistakes:</strong> Professional companies rarely make spelling errors</li>
                        <li><strong>Asking for Personal Info:</strong> Real banks never ask for passwords or PIN numbers by email</li>
                        <li><strong>Unexpected Messages:</strong> "You've won a prize!" (when you never entered a contest)</li>

                        <p>Sarah got an email saying her Netflix account would be closed unless she "verified" her payment details. She almost clicked the link, but noticed the email was from netflix.accounts@hotmail.com - not a real Netflix address. By being careful, she avoided having her credit card stolen!</p>
