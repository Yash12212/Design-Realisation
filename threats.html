                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>Imagine getting a letter that looks like it's from your bank, but it's actually from a scammer. That's what phishing is - but online!</p>
                    <h4>How to Spot Fake Messages:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Urgent Messages:</strong> "Your account will be closed if you don't act now!" - Real companies don't pressure you like this.</li>
                        <li><strong>Strange Email Addresses:</strong> amazonsupport@gmail.com instead of @amazon.com</li>
                        <li><strong>Spelling Mistakes:</strong> Professional companies rarely make spelling errors</li>
                        <li><strong>Asking for Personal Info:</strong> Real banks never ask for passwords or PIN numbers by email</li>
                        <li><strong>Unexpected Messages:</strong> "You've won a prize!" (when you never entered a contest)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <div class="real-world-example">
                        <h4>🌟 Real-Life Example</h4>
                        <p>Sarah got an email saying her Netflix account would be closed unless she "verified" her payment details. She almost clicked the link, but noticed the email was from netflix.accounts@hotmail.com - not a real Netflix address. By being careful, she avoided having her credit card stolen!</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>How to Stay Safe:</h4>
                    <ul class="feature-list">
                        <li>✅ Go directly to websites instead of clicking email links</li>
                        <li>✅ Call your bank using the number on your card if you're unsure</li>
                        <li>✅ Never send passwords or bank details by email</li>
                        <li>✅ If something feels wrong, it probably is - trust your instincts!</li>

                    <p>Think of malware like germs for your computer - they can make your device "sick" and cause all sorts of problems!</p>
                    <h4>Warning Signs Your Device Might Be Infected:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>🐌 Your device becomes very slow</li>
                        <li>🔋 Battery drains quickly</li>

                        <p>John downloaded what he thought was a free movie. Soon after, his computer started showing endless pop-up ads and running very slowly. He had accidentally downloaded malware along with the movie. Remember: if something is offered for free when it usually costs money, it might be a trap!</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>How to Keep Your Devices Healthy:</h4>

                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>Imagine coming home to find all your family photos and important documents locked in a safe, and someone demanding money for the key. That's what ransomware does to your computer!</p>
                    <h4>What Happens in a Ransomware Attack:</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>🔒 Your files get locked (encrypted)</li>
                        <li>💰 Criminals demand payment to unlock them</li>
                        <li>⏰ They often set a deadline to pay</li>
                        <li>😢 If you don't pay, you might lose your files forever</li>
                    </ol>
                    <div class="real-world-example">
                        <h4>🌟 Real-Life Example</h4>
                        <p>Mary's computer showed a scary message: all her wedding photos and documents were locked, and she needed to pay $500 in Bitcoin to get them back. Luckily, she had backed up her photos to an external drive last week, so she didn't lose anything important!</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>How to Protect Yourself:</h4>

                <div class="details-content">
                    <p>Think of a data breach like a store being robbed - except instead of stealing money, thieves steal customer information. This happens to big companies more often than you might think!</p>
                    <h4>What Gets Stolen:</h4>
                    <ul>

                        <p>After a popular store was hacked, Tom started getting strange emails from scammers who knew his name and where he shopped. This is why it's important to use different passwords for different websites - if one gets hacked, the others stay safe!</p>
                    </div>
                    <h4>What to Do If Your Data Is Stolen:</h4>
